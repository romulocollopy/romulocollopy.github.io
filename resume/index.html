    <section name="about">
      <p>
        I'm a software developer passionate about Software Architecture, Design
        Patterns, and TDD. Although I've worked with various programming
        languages, Python is the one I've specialized in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my carrer working in small businesses, where I had the opportunity
        to participate in decisions about product features, architecture, technology, and budget.
        The teams were usually small and we would take care of all phases of development and ops.
        Many of those teams were self-managed and established their own work
        methodologies, mixing different agile techniques such as Scrum and
        Kanban.
      </p>

      <p>
        My proficiency in software architecture eventually led me to roles in larger companies where 
        I collaborated with product teams to enhance existing solutions and elevate software quality.
        During this time, I focused on spreading Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and SOLID
        principles across engineering teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with both front-end and back-end technologies and have a good
        understanding of DevOps techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last years, I've been dedicating my personal studies to statically typed languages, 
        and building projects using Domain Driven Desing especially Rust.
