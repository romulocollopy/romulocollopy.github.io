    <section name="about">
        <p>I'm a software developer passionate about Software
            Architecture, Design Patterns, and TDD. Although I've worked
            with several different programming languages, Python is the one
            I've specialized in.</p>

        <p>Working in small businesses, I had the opportunity to participate on decisions about product
            features, architecture, technology, and budget. Several of those teams were self-managed teams and set their
            own work methodology, mixing
            different agile techniques, such as Scrum and Kamban.</p>

        <p>After working in a big scale organization, I have changed to my current position in a scale-up that has its
            challenges in terms of fortifying their processes and technical background.
            There I lead a small engineering team, organizing the roadmap and keeping it aligned with the technical
            leadership vision.</p>

        <p>I work with both front-end and back-end and have a good knowledge of
            DevOps techniques.</p>

        <p>Recently, I have been studying statically typed languages
            through a personal project using Rust communication through gRPC</p>
