    <section name="about">
        <p>
            Web Developer specialized in Python with considerable knowledge in JavaScript, Ruby and other scripting languages. Interested in DevOps, continuous integration and agile methodologies.
            Currently I work in a 8 years old ecosystem, constituted of 5 applications running in Python and Ruby. We have many challenges in the infrastructure, such as integrating new features in the legacy code and serving more than 800 clients, including the operation of 15 hospitals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team, although small, has managed to improve the amazon infrastructure and deploy process from a very old model based in scripts, to more imperative ways of deploy, using ansible, docker and kubernetes in some parts. We were also capable of extracting some of the old functionality to a separate service with improved architecture and up to date technology. Our error metrics lowered more than 70% and we have more reliable software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I started developing, I've been focused in software maintainability, aiming to build softwares capable of being quickly evolved and changed. I tend to avoid premature optimizations and I believe the applications should be monitored and optimized in the important points.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy writing unitary and integration tests and to keep the code continuously integrated. I'm also interested in linux systems administration and DevOps tasks, always looking for better ways to ship my code.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a former project manager I also care about the process of planning, building and delivering software in the best possible way to the company and the crew.
        </p>
        <p>
            The position I could contribute faster to the companies is as a backend developer, specially using Python. Nevertheless I'm eager to learn new things, and I could fit in other positions if the company is able to deal with my learning curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I'm a team player and enjoy helping my coworkers every time I can, and -- of course -- learning from their experience. In addition to it, I use to participate of software conferences and to contribute with open source projects.
